  "faqs": [
    {
      "category": "Bike Selection",
      "question": "What type of bike should I choose for daily commuting in Indian cities?",
      "answer": "For daily commuting in Indian cities, opt for a lightweight commuter bike with a 100-150cc engine, offering high mileage (50-70 kmpl) and easy handling in traffic. Examples include Bajaj Platina 100 or Pulsar 150. Consider fuel efficiency, comfort, and maintenance costs. Test ride to ensure the bike suits your height and riding posture."
    },
    {
      "category": "Bike Selection",
      "question": "Which bike is best for long-distance rides or highway cruising?",
      "answer": "Cruiser or touring bikes like Bajaj Avenger Cruise 220 or Dominar 400 are ideal for long-distance rides due to their ergonomic design, comfortable seating, and powerful engines (200cc+). Look for features like ABS and good suspension for safety and comfort."
    },
    {
      "category": "Bike Selection",
      "question": "How do I choose a bike that fits my body size?",
      "answer": "Ensure your feet can comfortably touch the ground when stopped. Check seat height, handlebar position, and bike weight. For taller riders (e.g., 6'4\"), bikes like Bajaj Dominar 400 or Avenger Street 160 offer better ergonomics. Test ride to confirm fit and control."
    },
    {
      "category": "Bike Selection",
      "question": "Should I buy a petrol or CNG bike like the Bajaj Freedom 125?",
      "answer": "Petrol bikes are better for long-distance travel due to wider fuel availability. CNG bikes like Bajaj Freedom 125 are eco-friendly and cost-effective (lower running costs) for city commuting, but CNG stations are limited. Choose based on your commute and local CNG infrastructure in Hyderabad."
    },
    {
      "category": "Bike Selection",
      "question": "What are the benefits of choosing a Bajaj bike over other brands?",
      "answer": "Bajaj bikes are known for reliability, fuel efficiency, and affordable maintenance. Models like Pulsar and Platina offer a range of options for commuters and enthusiasts, with features like DTS-i engines and ABS. Bajaj’s wide service network ensures easy access to spare parts."
    },
    {
      "category": "Performance",
      "question": "What engine size (cc) is suitable for a beginner rider?",

    },
    {
      "category": "Performance",
      "question": "How do I check a bike’s real-world mileage?",
      "answer": "Check online reviews from users or automotive portals like BikeWale for real-world mileage. Test ride the bike to gauge performance under your riding conditions. For example, Bajaj Platina 100 offers ~72 kmpl, while Pulsar NS200 gives ~35-40 kmpl."
    },
    {
      "category": "Performance",

      "answer": "Prioritize bikes with Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) (e.g., Bajaj Pulsar N160), disc brakes, and good tyres for grip. Single or dual-channel ABS prevents wheel lockup during sudden braking. Check for LED headlights for better visibility."
    },
    {
      "category": "Cost and Financing",
      "question": "What additional costs should I consider beyond the bike’s price?",

Bajaj dealers facilitate loans via partners like Bajaj Finance."
    },
